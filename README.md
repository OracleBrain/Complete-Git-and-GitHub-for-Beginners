 Hi everyone, I am Aashis Jha and welcome to New Repo In today's Repo, we are going to cover in detail about Git and GitHub So we will read Git and GitHub in detail from scratch If we have no idea about what is Git, what is GitHub, how to use them, what commands we use then there is nothing to worry about, we will cover everything from basics to the highest level Along with this, we have given you you cheat sheet for all the git commands you can download it as well when we talk about git, it is a very important tool which every developer should know how to use because if we do any type of development then when we work on large projects or in fact if we work on small projects then it is important to have basic knowledge of git along with that, we should know how to upload our projects on github We should know about the basic commands of git What are the differences between git and github How can we run github Like branches, forking, what are the meanings of different concepts A good developer should know all these things And we have covered all these things in detail in this Repo So now let's start with our Git and GitHub. Whenever we will read Git and GitHub, there are many things that can be covered. But in this repo, we will be covering the most important things in detail. That is, the things that we are practically using on a day-to-day basis. First of all, let's talk about what is Git actually?


------ Git ------
➢ Git is a Version Control System. It is: (Git is a kind a version control system Version control systems are tools that help us to track changes in code You can think of it like we have a bank account and there is a statement in the bank account that when an amount was credited when the amount was debited when the amount was taxed There is a lot of information like this When we save such information for a code or project So we do it in the form of a version control system That is, the version control system tracks the entire history of the project When a new file was added in that code When a file was deleted What did we update in the code, what did we change, which line was deleted So all such history, version control system is so all this history is tracked by version control systems ) and git is a very popular version control system there are many reasons to use git first of all, 

✦ popular (git is one of the most popular version control systems in the world it is not just for day to day projects even while working in companies, we use Git and GitHub. to manage its code.) The second reason is that 

✦ Free & Open Source (Git is our free and open source. Anyone can use it freely. We don't have to pay anything.) And third, 

✦ Fast & scalable (it is fast and it is scalable. No matter how small or big the project is)

git can always be of use we primarily use git for two things the first thing is ;

✦ to track the history whose history? our code's history (for example, we are working on a big project we are trying to make a website we are adding many features on the website first of all, in features we may have added a signup page then we may have added some buttons on our website. Then it is possible that we have brought some new feature. For example, we have added a form on our website for help. Now it is possible that the form of help is taking a lot of time to build this feature. We are having a lot of problems in building this feature. So we want to build this feature in some phase later. We want our code to be the same as we completed our code to the button feature. So one way is to manually sit and delete each file which we have written separately for help. Each line of code should be deleted. Every change should be deleted and reverted. But if we work on large-scale projects and projects then it is risky to do all this manually that's why we need some automatic software which tells us how much code was written till the buttons that means we have an old history that we have written this line of code till here and if we want we can go to that phase of our project that's why it is important to track the history of our project which GIT does)

for us the second major thing that Git helps us do is to

✦ collaborate ( Collaborate means working with a team. For example, if we are in a college, we are working on our solo projects. But in a company, many developers are working on each project. So it is very important to track the changes have been made in a project and what features have been changed by which developer. And all people should not overwrite each other's changes. Overwrite means if one person is changing in the same file and the other person is changing, then the changes of which developer should be accepted in that file. There are many such problems. And we do the work of resolving such problems using git. So git helps us in collaboration) 

it helps us in tracking the history of our code so git is not just a tool for us it is not a means it is a skill that we learn and not only on our projects but also throughout our developer journey 

git is a tool we can understand it as a software that runs on our computer system. now this is about git <!----------next we will talk about what is github---------------->

--------------- Github -------------------

✦ Website that allows developers to store and manage their code using Git.

✦ https://github.com ()
